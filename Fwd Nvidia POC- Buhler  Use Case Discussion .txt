Hi Srikanth, 
Thanks a lot for your time. PFA the completed Business Use case. 
As agreed these are our next steps 
1.	You will take the proposal with Nvidia to run through them to get the expert advice 
2.	We will check for the data set and also the DGX box connectivity. 
3.	If DGX doesn’t come up, AWS should be considered as an option. 
 
Thanks, 
Lakshmi Prabha K.
